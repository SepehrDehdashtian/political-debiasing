# Backbones folder

The files here are taken from ArcFace repo (https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/). The files contain iresnet.py, iresnet2060.py and mobilefacenet.py. Out of these, we will be relying on iResNet50 from iresnet.py. The weights for this model will have to be downloaded separately.
